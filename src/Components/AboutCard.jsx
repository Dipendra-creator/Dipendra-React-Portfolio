            <p>A few years ago I was lucky enough to find what I'm passionate about, and in 2019 I started pursuing BTech in Computer Science from GLA University, Mathura. I have an unending curiosity for learning how technology works, specifically programming. I've built my own AI models in some projects, explored cybersecurity and <span className="high">Machine Learning & Deep Learning</span>, created Games in Flutter, and more, but ultimately my passion is web development. I specialize in JavaScript, React, Three.js, and Node.js, but I'm almost always learning new web technologies so I can see my ideas and my programming come to life.</p>
